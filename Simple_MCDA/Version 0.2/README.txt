Title: Simple MCDA
Version: 0.2

Purpose:
Put simply this is an attempt at creating an efficient, yet simple single synthesis Multi-Criteria Decision Making Analysis (MCDA). To reiterate, the main goal of this QGIS GUI is to ensure that beginners have an accessible, and easy to use tool should the need arise. This plugin utilizes dynamic programming, and multiple character filters to ensure that the user has a range of mobility, in terms of possible fields used, as well as an un-hindered experience. 

Note:
Included is a zip file containing all the necessary files to upload this tool. This plugin can also be downloaded through the QGIS Plugin Manager.

Version Note:
A few egregious bugs, and process errors were found, and subsequently dealt with.
